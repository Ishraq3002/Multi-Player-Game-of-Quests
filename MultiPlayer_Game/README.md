Author: Md Ishraq Tanzim

Project Overview:

Multi-Player Game of Quests is a text-based multiplayer game developed in Java, designed for players to complete a series of quests in a collaborative and interactive environment. The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles to ensure high-quality software. The game was initially built as a text-based console application and later transitioned to a web-based interface using Agile Scrum practices.

Features:

Multiplayer Gameplay: Players can join and complete quests, interact with other players, and strategize together.

Test-Driven Development (TDD): Developed using JUnit for comprehensive unit testing to ensure code quality.

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD): Scenario modeling using Cucumber to cover functional aspects and user behavior.

Regression Testing: Automated regression testing performed using Selenium to ensure the quality and functionality of the web version.

Technology Stack:

Java: Used for developing the game logic and core features.

JUnit: Utilized for unit testing in the TDD approach.

Cucumber: Used for BDD, modeling scenarios to validate functionality.

Selenium: Used for regression testing after transitioning to a web interface.

Maven: Build automation and dependency management (pom.xml file included).

GitHub: Version control and collaboration platform for managing the project.

Jira: Agile project management to track development progress and task assignments.

Agile Scrum: Development methodology followed for iterative and incremental development of the project.

How to Play:

Launch the game.

Follow the prompts to enter player names and start quests.

Players will be presented with quests that they can complete collaboratively.

The game flow is turn-based, and players take actions by selecting available options.
